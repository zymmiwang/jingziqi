## Installing via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Downloader)

    PM> Install-Package Downloader

## Installing via the .NET Core command line interface

    dotnet add package Downloader

# How to use

## **Step 1**: Create your custom configuration

### Simple Configuration

```csharp
var downloadOpt = new DownloadConfiguration()
{
    ChunkCount = 8, // file parts to download, default value is 1
    ParallelDownload = true // download parts of file as parallel or not. Default value is false
};
```

### Complex Configuration


> **Note**: *Do not use all of the below options in your applications, just add which one you need.*

```csharp
var downloadOpt = new DownloadConfiguration()
{
    // usually, hosts support max to 8000 bytes, default values is 8000
    BufferBlockSize = 10240,
    // file parts to download, default value is 1
    ChunkCount = 8,             
    // download speed limited to 2MB/s, default values is zero or unlimited
    MaximumBytesPerSecond = 1024*1024*2, 
    // the maximum number of times to fail
    MaxTryAgainOnFailover = 5,    
    // download parts of file as parallel or not. Default value is false
    ParallelDownload = true,
    // number of parallel downloads. The default value is the same as the chunk count
    ParallelCount = 4,    
    // timeout (millisecond) per stream block reader, default values is 1000
    Timeout = 1000,      
    // set true if you want to download just a specific range of bytes of a large file
    RangeDownload = false,
    // floor offset of download range of a large file
    RangeLow = 0,
    // ceiling offset of download range of a large file
    RangeHigh = 0, 
    // clear package chunks data when download completed with failure, default value is false
    ClearPackageOnCompletionWithFailure = true, 
    // minimum size of chunking to download a file in multiple parts, default value is 512
    MinimumSizeOfChunking = 1024, 
    // Before starting the download, reserve the storage space of the file as file size, default value is false
    ReserveStorageSpaceBeforeStartingDownload = true; 
    // config and customize request headers
    RequestConfiguration = 
    {        
        Accept = "*/*",
        CookieContainer = cookies,
        Headers = new WebHeaderCollection(), // { your custom headers }
        KeepAlive = true, // default value is false
        ProtocolVersion = HttpVersion.Version11, // default value is HTTP 1.1
        UseDefaultCredentials = false,
        // your custom user agent or your_app_name/app_version.
        UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)",
        Proxy = new WebProxy() {
           Address = new Uri("http://YourProxyServer/proxy.pac"),
           UseDefaultCredentials = false,
           Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials,
           BypassProxyOnLocal = true
        }
    }
};
```

## **Step 2**: Create download service instance per download and pass your config

```csharp
var downloader = new DownloadService(downloadOpt);
```

## **Step 3**: Handle download events

```csharp
// Provide `FileName` and `TotalBytesToReceive` at the start of each downloads
downloader.DownloadStarted += OnDownloadStarted;

// Provide any information about chunker downloads, 
// like progress percentage per chunk, speed, 
// total received bytes and received bytes array to live streaming.
downloader.ChunkDownloadProgressChanged += OnChunkDownloadProgressChanged;

// Provide any information about download progress, 
// like progress percentage of sum of chunks, total speed, 
// average speed, total received bytes and received bytes array 
// to live streaming.
downloader.DownloadProgressChanged += OnDownloadProgressChanged;

// Download completed event that can include occurred errors or 
// cancelled or download completed successfully.
downloader.DownloadFileCompleted += OnDownloadFileCompleted;
```

## **Step 4**: Start the download with the url and file name

```csharp
string file = @"Your_Path\fileName.zip";
string url = @"https://file-examples.com/fileName.zip";
await downloader.DownloadFileTaskAsync(url, file);
```

## **Step 4b**: Start the download without file name

```csharp
DirectoryInfo path = new DirectoryInfo("Your_Path");
string url = @"https://file-examples.com/fileName.zip";
// download into "Your_Path\fileName.zip"
await downloader.DownloadFileTaskAsync(url, path); 
```

## **Step 4c**: Download in MemoryStream

```csharp
// After download completion, it gets a MemoryStream
Stream destinationStream = await downloader.DownloadFileTaskAsync(url); 
```

## How to **pause** and **resume** downloads quickly

When you want to resume a download quickly after pausing a few seconds. You can call the `Pause` function of the downloader service. This way, streams stay alive and are only suspended by a locker to be released and resumed whenever you want.

```csharp
// Pause the download
DownloadService.Pause();

// Resume the download
DownloadService.Resume();
```

---
## How to **stop** and **resume** downloads other time

The ‚Äç`DownloadService` class has a property called `Package` that stores each step of the download. To stopping the download you must call the `CancelAsync` method. Now, if you want to continue again, you must call the same `DownloadFileTaskAsync` function with the `Package` parameter to resume your download. For example:

```csharp
// At first, keep and store the Package file to resume 
// your download from the last download position:
DownloadPackage pack = downloader.Package;
```

**Stop or cancel download:**

```csharp
// This function breaks your stream and cancels progress.
downloader.CancelAsync();
```

**Resuming download after cancelation:**

```csharp
await downloader.DownloadFileTaskAsync(pack);
```

So that you can even save your large downloads with a very small amount in the Package and after restarting the program, restore it again and start continuing your download. 
The packages are your snapshot of the download instance. Only the downloaded file addresses will be included in the package and you can resume it whenever you want. 
For more detail see [StopResumeDownloadTest](https://github.com/bezzad/Downloader/blob/master/src/Downloader.Test/IntegrationTests/DownloadIntegrationTest.cs#L115) method

> Note: Sometimes a server does not support downloading in a specific range. That time, we can't resume downloads after canceling. So, the downloader starts from the beginning.

## Fluent download builder usage

For easy and fluent use of the downloader, you can use the `DownloadBuilder` class. Consider the following examples:

Simple usage:

```csharp
await DownloadBuilder.New()
    .WithUrl(@"https://host.com/test-file.zip")
    .WithDirectory(@"C:\temp")
    .Build()
    .StartAsync();
```

Complex usage:

```csharp
IDownload download = DownloadBuilder.New()
    .WithUrl(@"https://host.com/test-file.zip")
    .WithDirectory(@"C:\temp")
    .WithFileName("test-file.zip")
    .WithConfiguration(new DownloadConfiguration())
    .Build();

download.DownloadProgressChanged += DownloadProgressChanged;
download.DownloadFileCompleted += DownloadFileCompleted;
download.DownloadStarted += DownloadStarted;
download.ChunkDownloadProgressChanged += ChunkDownloadProgressChanged;

await download.StartAsync();

download.Stop(); // cancel current download
```

Resume the existing download package:

```csharp
await DownloadBuilder.Build(package).StartAsync();
```

Resume the existing download package with a new configuration:

```csharp
await DownloadBuilder.Build(package, config).StartAsync();
```

[Pause and Resume quickly](https://github.com/bezzad/Downloader/blob/master/src/Downloader.Test/UnitTests/DownloadBuilderTest.cs#L110):

```csharp
var download = DownloadBuilder.New()
     .Build()
     .WithUrl(url)
     .WithFileLocation(path);
await download.StartAsync();

download.Pause(); // pause current download quickly

download.Resume(); // continue current download quickly
```

## When does Downloader fail to download in multiple chunks?

### Content-Length:
If your URL server does not provide the file size in the response header (`Content-Length`). 
The Downloader cannot split the file into multiple parts and continues its work with one chunk.

### Accept-Ranges:
If the server return `Accept-Ranges: none` in the responses header then that means the server does not support download in range and 
the Downloader cannot use multiple chunking and continues its work with one chunk.

### Content-Range:
At first, the Downloader sends a GET request to the server to fetch the file's size in the range. 
If the server does not provide `Content-Range` in the header then that means the server does not support download in range. 
Therefore, the Downloader has to continue its work with one chunk.

## How to serialize and deserialize downloader package

### **What is Serialization?**

Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into information that can be stored for later retrieval or that can be sent to another system. For example, you may have an object that represents a document that you wish to save. This object could be serialized to a stream of binary information and stored as a file on disk. Later the binary data can be retrieved from the file and deserialized into objects that are exact copies of the original information. As a second example, you may have an object containing the details of a transaction that you wish to send to a non-.NET system. This information could be serialised to XML before being transmitted. The receiving system would convert the XML into a format that it could understand.

In this section, we want to show how to serialize download packages to `JSON` text or `Binary`, after stopping download to keep download data and resuming that every time you want.
You can serialize packages even using memory storage for caching download data which is used `MemoryStream`.

### **JSON Serialization**

Serializing the package to [`JSON`](https://www.newtonsoft.com) is very simple like this:

```csharp
var packageJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(package);
```

Deserializing into the new package:

```csharp
var newPack = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<DownloadPackage>(packageJson);
```

For more detail see [PackageSerializationTest](https://github.com/bezzad/Downloader/blob/46167082b8de99d8e6ad21329c3a32a6e26cfd3e/src/Downloader.Test/DownloadPackageTest.cs#L34) method

### **Binary Serialization**


To serialize or deserialize the package into a binary file, first you need serialize to JSON and next save it with [BinaryWriter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.binarywriter).

> **NOTE**: 
The [BinaryFormatter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.formatters.binary.binaryformatter) type is dangerous and is not recommended for data processing. 
Applications should stop using [BinaryFormatter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.formatters.binary.binaryformatter) as soon as possible, even if they believe the data they're processing to be trustworthy. 
[BinaryFormatter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.formatters.binary.binaryformatter) is insecure and can't be made secure. 
So, [BinaryFormatter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.serialization.formatters.binary.binaryformatter) is deprecated and we can no longer support it. 
[Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide)
# Instructions for Contributing

Welcome to contribute, feel free to change and open a [**PullRequest**](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) to develop branch.
You can use either the latest version of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and .NET CLI for Windows, Mac and Linux.

For GitHub workflow, check out our Git workflow below this paragraph. We are following the excellent GitHub Flow process, and would like to make sure you have all of the information needed to be a world-class contributor!

## Git Workflow

The general process for working with Downloader is:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) on GitHub
1. Make sure your line endings are correctly configured and fix your line endings!
1. Clone your fork locally
1. Configure the upstream repo (`git remote add upstream git://github.com/bezzad/downloader`)
1. Switch to the latest development branch (eg vX.Y.Z, using `git checkout vX.Y.Z`)
1. Create a local branch from that (`git checkout -b myBranch`).
1. Work on your feature
1. Rebase if required
1. Push the branch up to GitHub (`git push origin myBranch`)
1. Send a Pull Request on GitHub - the PR should target (have as base branch) the latest development branch (eg `vX.Y.Z`) rather than `master`.

We accept pull requests from the community. But, you should **never** work on a clone of master, and you should **never** send a pull request from master - always from a branch. Please be sure to branch from the head of the latest vX.Y.Z `develop` branch (rather than `master`) when developing contributions.
